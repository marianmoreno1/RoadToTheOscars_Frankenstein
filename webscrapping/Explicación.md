## Web Scraping Scripts

This repository contains five main web scraping scripts used for data collection in the project.

- One script is specifically dedicated to capturing the fully rendered HTML of Rotten Tomatoes using **Selenium**, allowing access to dynamic content generated by JavaScript (including reviews loaded via scroll and "Load More" buttons).
- The remaining scripts extract and structure reviews from the different platforms analyzed (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, YouTube, and Google News).
- All extracted data is exported in a clean and reproducible format, ready for sentiment analysis, word frequency analysis, and insight generation.

The goal is to ensure a systematic, automated, and replicable data collection process.
